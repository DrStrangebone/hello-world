New to git, learning :)

Here goes editing, nothing special!

I had rough time understanding C++ although I enjoyed programming the basics but beyond that - whoosh over my head.
Python has already rocked my socks off, so now I'm learning git in hopes of receiving feedbacks. 
That's not just the thing though, a lot of users have suggested me to learn github. So here I am! :D
